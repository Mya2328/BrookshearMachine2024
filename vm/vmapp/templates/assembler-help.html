    <h1>Extended Brookshear Machine Assembler</h1>
    <p>
      This is an assembler for the machine described in
      <em>Computer Science: An Overview</em>, 10th edition, by J. Glenn
      Brookshear (Pearson Education, 2008). The machine is extended with three
      additional instructions.

    <h2 id="conventions">Conventions</h2>
    <p>
      Text in italics in a format is a placeholder: it needs to be replaced with
      an appropriate character sequence to make a legal instruction. The
      characters m, n, p, x and y stand for hex characters.
    </p>
    <p>Hex characters are 0-9, A-F, and a-f.</p>

    <h2 id="file-format">File format</h2>
    <p>
      The assembly language file is a plain text file and can be prepared using
      a text editor such as the Matlab editor, WordPad, Notepad, Emacs, or vi.
      It is read as a sequence of lines. Each line contains one statement, with
      the format:
    </p>
    <pre>location instruction comment</pre>
    <p>where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>location</strong> has the format <em>xy:</em> or
        <em>label:</em> (note the colon at the end) and is described below in
        the section "Addresses and Labels".
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>instruction</strong> has the format <em>OP args</em>, where OP
        specifies an operation. Instructions are described in the sections
        below.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>comment</strong> has the format <em>// text</em> and is ignored.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Any or all of the three components may be omitted. White space before any
      of the components is ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first example below has all three components, the second has only a
      location and a comment, and the third has only an instruction:
    </p>
    <pre>
loop:   ADDI R1, R2 -> R3   // increment loop counter
A0:     // next instruction will be loaded at location A0
ROT  R1, 4
    </pre>

    <h2 id="assembly">Assembly and loading process</h2>
    <p>
      Each assembly language instruction, except DATA, is translated into a
      single Brookshear Machine (BM) instruction. The code for this instruction
      is allocated to two memory cells, starting at the next free cell unless
      this is overridden by an explicit address in the location field (see
      "Addresses and Labels" below).
    </p>
    <p>
      BM execution normally starts from address 0, and so the first instruction
      in the program should usually be stored at address 0. This is the default
      if no explicit address is given.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output of the assembler can be loaded directly into memory or saved as
      a machine code file, which may then be loaded. These options are described
      in the <button id="helperBtn2" class="link-btn">general help for the emulator</button>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="mov">MOV instruction</h2>
    <p>
      The MOV instruction moves (or more precisely copies) a byte of data from
      one location to another. Its general format is:
    </p>
    <pre>MOV source -> destination</pre>
    <p>
      The source and destination may be specified in a variety of ways,
      corresponding to different addressing modes. Six different combinations
      are legal, as follows.
    </p>

    <h3>MOV <span class="subtitle-text">value -> Rn</span></h3>
    <p>
      The value is fixed when the assembly language is written, and it is stored
      in memory as part of the program. (This is immediate-mode addressing.) It
      may be specified in the assembler instruction in one of the following
      ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Two hex characters, optionally followed by "h", e.g. 1Ch, 13, 02. Note
        that a value of 13 means hexadecimal 13, i.e. decimal 19, not decimal
        13.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eight binary characters (0 or 1), optionally followed by "b", e.g.
        00010101, 11011111b.
      </li>
      <li>
        A signed decimal integer in the range -128 to +127. This is written with
        a leading + or - sign followed by 1, 2 or 3 decimal characters (0-9). If
        it is positive and has only one digit, the sign may be omitted. E.g.
        -100, 7, +33. The value stored represents the integer in twos complement
        format.
      </li>
      <li>
        A floating point number in the range -7.5 to 7.5. This is written with
        an optional sign and must contain a decimal point. There must be at
        least one decimal digit before the point. E.g. 0.0, -3.2, +4., 0.03. The
        value stored represents the number, or an approximation to it, in the
        floating-point format described in the emulator documentation and in
        <em>Computer Science: An Overview</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        A single ASCII character, written between quotes. E.g. "c", ",", """,
        "8". The ASCII code for the character is stored.
      </li>
      <li>A label. See the section below on addresses and labels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The destination must be a register. This is written as <em>Rn</em> where
      <em>n</em> is a hex character that specifies which register receives the
      data. (BM opcode: 2.)
    </p>

    <h3>MOV <span class="subtitle-text">Rm -> Rn</span></h3>
    <p>
      The value held in register Rm is copied to register Rn, where m and n
      specify the source and destination registers respectively. (BM opcode: 4.)
    </p>

    <h3>MOV <span class="subtitle-text">[xy] -> Rn</span></h3>
    <p>
      The value held in the memory cell with address xy is loaded into register
      Rn. A label may be used instead of an explicit address. (The source is
      specified using direct addressing.) (BM opcode: 1.)
    </p>

    <h3>MOV <span class="subtitle-text">Rn -> [xy]</span></h3>
    <p>
      The value held in register Rn is stored in the memory cell with address
      xy. A label may be used instead of an explicit address. (The destination
      uses direct addressing.) (BM opcode: 3.)
    </p>

    <h3>MOV <span class="subtitle-text">[Rm] -> Rn</span></h3>
    <p>
      The value held in the memory cell whose address is in register Rm is
      loaded into register Rn. (The source uses register indirect addressing.)
      (BM opcode: D.)
    </p>

    <h3>MOV <span class="subtitle-text">Rn -> [Rm]</span></h3>
    <p>
      The value held in register Rn is stored in the memory cell whose address
      is in register Rm. (The destination uses register indirect addressing.)
      (BM opcode: E.)
    </p>

    <h2 id="register">Register operation instructions</h2>
    <h3>ROT <span class="subtitle-text">Rn, x</span></h3>
    <p>
      The bit pattern in register Rn is rotated x bits to the right. For
      example, if x is 1, the rightmost bit is moved to the left and every other
      bit is moved 1 place to the right: 00010001 becomes 10001000 and 01011011
      becomes 10101101. Higher values of x are equivalent to repeating this
      process x times altogether. Rn is updated to contain the new pattern. (BM
      opcode: A.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Each of the remaining register instructions represents an operation with
      two inputs and one output. These have the general form:
    </p>
    <pre>OP Rn, Rm -> Rp</pre>
    <p>
      <em>OP</em> specifies the operation to be carried out. Registers Rn and Rm
      contain the source data, and register Rp is the destination in which the
      result of the operation is stored. Any pair, or all three, of m, n, and p
      may be the same.
    </p>

    <h3>ADDI <span class="subtitle-text">Rn, Rm -> Rp</span></h3>
    <p>
      The contents of Rn and Rm are added, assuming that they represent signed
      integers in twos complement format. (BM opcode: 5.)
    </p>

    <h3>ADDF <span class="subtitle-text">Rn, Rm -> Rp</span></h3>
    <p>
      The contents of Rn and Rm are added, assuming that they represent floating
      point numbers in the format described in the emulator help document and in
      <em>Computer Science: An Overview</em>. (BM opcode: 6.)
    </p>

    <h3>OR <span class="subtitle-text">Rn, Rm -> Rp</span></h3>
    <p>
      A bitwise OR operation is carried out. That is, each bit of Rp is 1 if
      either of the corresponding bits in Rn and Rm is 1. (BM opcode: 7.)
    </p>

    <h3>AND <span class="subtitle-text">Rn, Rm -> Rp</span></h3>
    <p>A bitwise AND operation is carried out. (BM opcode: 8.)</p>

    <h3>XOR <span class="subtitle-text">Rn, Rm -> Rp</span></h3>
    <p>A bitwise XOR operation is carried out. (BM opcode: 9.)</p>

    <h2 id="control">Control instructions</h2>
    <p>
      Jump instructions cause the program counter to be set to the specified
      address, so that the next instruction executed is the one at that address.
    </p>

    <h3>JMP <span class="subtitle-text">xy</span></h3>
    <p>
      Jump to address xy (2 hex digits). The address xy can also be a label -
      see the section on addresses and labels. (BM opcode: B.)
    </p>

    <h3>JMP <span class="subtitle-text">Rn</span></h3>
    <p>Jump to the address that is held in register Rn. (BM opcode: F.)</p>

    <h3>JMPEQ <span class="subtitle-text">xy, Rm</span></h3>
    <p>
      Jump to address xy, if the contents of register Rm are equal to the
      contents of register R0; otherwise, continue to the next instruction in
      sequence. The address xy can be a label. (BM opcode: B.)
    </p>

    <h3>JMPEQ <span class="subtitle-text">Rn, Rm</span></h3>
    <p>
      Jump to the address held in register Rn, if the contents of register Rm
      are equal to the contents of register R0; otherwise, continue to the next
      instruction in sequence. (BM opcode: F.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining jump instructions all have the same form as this and are all
      implemented with BM opcode F.
    </p>

    <h3>JMPNE <span class="subtitle-text">Rn, Rm</span></h3>
    <p>
      Jump to the address in Rn if the contents of Rm are not equal to the
      contents of R0.
    </p>

    <h3>JMPGE <span class="subtitle-text">Rn, Rm</span></h3>
    <p>
      Jump if the contents of Rm are greater than or equal to the contents of
      R0, comparing them as unsigned integers.
    </p>

    <h3>JMPLE <span class="subtitle-text">Rn, Rm</span></h3>
    <p>
      Jump if the contents of Rm are less than or equal to the contents of R0,
      comparing them as unsigned integers.
    </p>

    <h3>JMPGT <span class="subtitle-text">Rn, Rm</span></h3>
    <p>
      Jump if the contents of Rm are greater than the contents of R0, comparing
      them as unsigned integers.
    </p>

    <h3>JMPLT <span class="subtitle-text">Rn, Rm</span></h3>
    <p>
      Jump if the contents of Rm are less than the contents of R0, comparing
      them as unsigned integers.
    </p>

    <h3>NOP</h3>
    <p>
      No operation. This instruction occupies two memory cells, but no actions
      take place when it is executed. (BM opcode: 0.)
    </p>

    <h3>HALT</h3>
    <p>Halt the machine. (BM opcode: C.)</p>

    <h2 id="data">DATA instruction</h2>
    <p>
      The DATA instruction does not translate into a BM instruction, but instead
      causes data to be loaded into memory alongside the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      If no explicit address is given in a location field, the data are loaded
      starting at the next free memory location - i.e. at the location that
      would otherwise be used for the next BM instruction. Since the BM starts
      execution at address 0, this means that in most cases DATA statements
      should come after the program.
    </p>
    <p>The instruction has two forms.</p>

    <h3>DATA <span class="subtitle-text">values</span></h3>
    <p>
      Here values is a list separated by commas and optional white space. Each
      element of the list is data for one byte of memory, and may be specified
      in any of the ways listed for the first form of the MOV instruction. For
      example
    </p>
    <pre>DATA -123, "s", DE</pre>
    <p>
      fills three bytes of memory with bit patterns representing the decimal
      integer -123, the ASCII character s, and the hex number DE.
    </p>

    <h3>DATA <span class="subtitle-text">string</span></h3>
    <p>
      Here string is a sequence of ASCII characters surrounded by double quotes.
      The character codes are stored in memory and then "null-terminated" - that
      is, the byte after the last character is set to 00h. For example
    </p>
    <pre>DATA "Some text"</pre>
    <p>
      fills 10 bytes of memory, 9 with the character codes for Some text and one
      with zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      The double quote character may be included in the string. The following
      example could therefore be ambiguous:
    </p>
    <pre>DATA "a","b"</pre>
    <p>
      In fact, it is interpreted as a single string - the five character codes
      for the characters a " , " b are put into memory, followed by a zero. To
      store the character codes for a and b, the following should be used:
    </p>
    <pre>DATA "ab"</pre>

    <h2 id="address">Addresses and Labels</h2>
    <p>
      The location field can be used in two ways. First, an explicit address may
      be given as two hex characters, for example
    </p>
    <pre>80: DATA "Text string"</pre>
    <p>
      This will cause the data to loaded starting from the memory cell with
      address 80 (hex).
    </p>
    <p>
      An address may be specified for any instruction, but its normal use is
      with a DATA statement, to store data in a specific location.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instructions or DATA statements that do not have addresses follow the
      previous instruction or data in memory. Thus an explicit address affects
      the position of subsequent instructions. For example
    </p>
    <pre>
1C: DATA 1, 2
    MOV R3 -> R4
    </pre>
    <p>causes the MOV statement to be stored at address 1E.</p>
    <p>
      An attempt to re-use a memory location will cause an error at assembly
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an address is given in a statement that does not contain an
      instruction, the address will be used for the next instruction (or data).
    </p>
    <p>
      he second way to use the location field is for a <strong>label</strong>. A
      label is a string of 4 or more characters starting with a letter. The
      other characters may be letters, digits or underscores.
    </p>
    <p>
      A label does not affect where anything is stored, but instead records the
      current address. For example
    </p>
    <pre>loop: ADDI R1, R2 -> R3</pre>

    <p>
      causes the address of the ADDI instruction to be associated with the label
      loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      A label may be used instead of a memory address or value in MOV, JMP and
      JMPEQ instructions - that is, wherever xy appears in an instruction format
      above. Thus the address associated with a label may be moved to a
      register, used as the source of a load or the destination of a store, or
      as the target of a jump. For example
    </p>
    <pre>
loop: ADDI R1, R2 -> R1
      MOV R1 -> [R4]
      JMP loop
    </pre>
    <p>causes the ADDI and MOV instructions to be repeated indefinitely.</p>
    <p>
      A reference to a label (its use as an argument to an instruction) may come
      before or after the label itself. A label may be defined (that is, appear
      in a location field) only once, but there may be any number of references
      to it.
    </p>

    <h2 id="example">Example</h2>
    <p>A program to draw a chessboard pattern in the bitmapped display.</p>
    <p>// Generates chessboard pattern in the bitmap display</p>
    <p>// R1 contains the address at which the next byte of data</p>
    <p>// is to be stored, and is also the loop counter. It is</p>
    <p>// incremented at the start of the loop so is initialised</p>
    <p>// to the location just before the start of display memory.</p>
    <p>// As there are 4 bytes per row of the display, and 4 rows of</p>
    <p>// display per row of the chessboard pattern, there are 16</p>
    <p>// bytes per chessboard row. This means that bit 4 of R1</p>
    <p>// (bits numbered 76543210) indicates whether an even or odd row</p>
    <p>// of the chessboard is being generated.</p>
    <p>// R3 and R4 contain the two patterns to store in the display,</p>
    <p>// depending on whether an odd or even row is being drawn.</p>
