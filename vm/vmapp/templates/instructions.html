                1rxy    Load memory[xy] into Rr
                2rxy    Load value xy into Rr
                3rxy    Store Rr in memory[xy]
                40rs    Move Rr to Rs
                5rst    Add as ints Rs, Rt, put result in Rr
                6rst    Add as floats Rs, Rt, put result in Rr
                7rst    OR each bit of Rs, Rt, put result in Rr
                8rst    AND each bit of Rs, Rt, put result in Rr
                9rst    XOR each bit of Rs, Rt, put result in Rr
                Ar0x    Rotate Rr x bits right
                Brxy    Jump to xy if Rr equals R0
                C000    Halt
                D0rs    Load memory [Rs] into Rr
                E0rs    Store Rr in memory [Rs]
                Frxt    Jump to address in Rt if Rr test R0
                    x = 0    means test is equals
                    x = 1    means test is not equal
                    x = 2    means test is greater or equal
                    x = 3    means test is less or equal
                    x = 4    means test is greater than
